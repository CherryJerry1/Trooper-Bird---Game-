# Trooper-Bird---Game-
Trooper Bird is a game that challenges players to navigate obstacles with precision. In this game, you control a bird that must move in all four directionsâ€”up, down, left, and right to avoid various obstacles while ensuring the precious letter remains secure in its beak.
It was a software development project for educational purpose. And my very first project.
